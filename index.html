         <p>O God of all creation
            Bless this our land and nation.
            Justice be our shield and defender
            May we dwell in unity
            Peace and liberty
            Plenty be found within our borders.</p>

         <p>Let one and all arise
            With hearts both strong and true.
            Service be our earnest endeavour,
            And our Homeland of Kenya
            Heritage of splendour,
            Firm may we stand to defend.</p>

           And the glory of Kenya
           The fruit of our labour
           Fill every heart with thanksgiving</p>
